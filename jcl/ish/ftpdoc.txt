NAME
     ftp - file transfer program

SYNOPSIS
     ftp [ -dgintv ]  [ -T timeout ]  [ _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e ]

DESCRIPTION
     The ftp command is the user interface to the Internet  stan-
     dard  File  Transfer  Protocol (FTP). ftp transfers files to
     and from a remote network site.

     The client host with which ftp  is  to  communicate  may  be
     specified  on the command line. If this is done, ftp immedi-
     ately attempts to establish a connection to an FTP server on
     that host; otherwise, ftp enters its command interpreter and
     awaits instructions from the user.   When  ftp  is  awaiting
     commands from the user, it displays the prompt ftp>.

OPTIONS
     The following options may be specified at the command  line,
     or to the command interpreter:

     -d    Enables debugging.

     -g    Disables filename "globbing."

     -i    Turns off interactive prompting during  multiple  file
           transfers.

     -n    Does not attempt "auto-login" upon initial connection.
           If  auto-login  is not disabled, ftp checks the .netrc
           file  in  the  user's  home  directory  for  an  entry
           describing  an  account  on the remote machine.  If no
           entry exists, ftp will prompt for the  login  name  of
           the  account on the remote machine (the default is the
           login name on the local machine), and,  if  necessary,
           prompts  for  a  password and an account with which to
           login.

     -t    Enables packet tracing (unimplemented).

     -T timeout
           Enables global connection timer, specified in  seconds
           (decimal). The timer is reset when anything is sent to
           the server on the  control  connection,  and  disabled
           while  the  client is prompting for user input. On the
           data connection, timeouts rely on  TCP  and  may  only
           timeout  on  network  outages  between  the client and
           server. It may  not  timeout,  for  instance,  if  the
           server is waiting for an NFS server.

     -v    Shows all responses from the remote server, as well as

           report on data transfer statistics.
            This is turned  on  by  default  if  ftp  is  running
           interactively  with  its  input coming from the user's
           terminal.

     The following commands  can  be  specified  to  the  command
     interpreter:

     !     [ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ] Runs  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  as a shell command  on  the
           local  machine.  If  no  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  is  given, invoke an
           interactive shell.

     $ _m_a_c_r_o-_n_a_m_e
           [ _a_r_g_s ]" 6 Execute  the  macro  _m_a_c_r_o-_n_a_m_e  that  was
           defined  with the macdef command. Arguments are passed
           to the macro unglobbed.

     account [ _p_a_s_s_w_d
           ]" 6 Supplies a supplemental password  required  by  a
           remote system for access to resources once a login has
           been  successfully  completed.   If  no  argument   is
           included,  the  user  will  be prompted for an account
           password in a non-echoing input mode.

     append _l_o_c_a_l-_f_i_l_e
           [ _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e ]" 6 Appends a local file to a  file  on
           the  remote  machine. If _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e is not specified,
           the local file name is used, subject to alteration  by
           any  ntrans  or nmap settings.  File transfer uses the
           current  settings  for  "representation  type",  "file
           structure", and "transfer mode".

     ascii Sets the "representation  type"  to  "network  ASCII".
           This is the default type.

     bell  Sounds a bell after each file transfer command is com-
           pleted.

     binary
           Sets the "representation type" to "image".

     bye   Terminates the FTP session with the remote server  and
           exit  ftp.  An EOF will also terminate the session and
           exit.

     case  Toggles remote computer file name case mapping  during
           mget  commands.   When  case  is  on (default is off),
           remote computer file names with all letters  in  upper
           case  are  written  in  the  local  directory with the
           letters mapped to lower case.

           Changes the working directory on the remote machine to
           _r_e_m_o_t_e-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

     cdup  Changes the remote machine working  directory  to  the
           parent  of  the  current remote machine working direc-
           tory.

     close Terminates the FTP session with the remote server, and
           return  to the command interpreter. Any defined macros
           are erased.

     cr    Toggles <RETURN> stripping during "network ASCII" type
           file    retrieval.    Records   are   denoted   by   a
           <RETURN>/LINEFEED sequence during "network ASCII" type
           file  transfer.  When cr is on (the default), <RETURN>
           characters are stripped from this sequence to  conform
           with the UNIX system single LINEFEED record delimiter.
           Records on non-UNIX-system remote  hosts  may  contain
           single  LINEFEED  characters;  when an "network ASCII"
           type transfer is made, these LINEFEED  characters  may
           be  distinguished from a record delimiter only when cr
           is off.

     delete _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e
           Deletes the file _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e on the remote machine.

     debug Toggles debugging mode.  When  debugging  is  on,  ftp
           prints  each  command sent to the remote machine, pre-
           ceded by the string ->.

     dir [ _r_e_m_o_t_e-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y ] [ _l_o_c_a_l-_f_i_l_e ]
           Prints a listing of  the  directory  contents  in  the
           directory,  _r_e_m_o_t_e-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y, and, optionally, placing
           the output in _l_o_c_a_l-_f_i_l_e. If no  directory  is  speci-
           fied,  the  current  working  directory  on the remote
           machine is used.  If no local file  is  specified,  or
           _l_o_c_a_l-_f_i_l_e is -, output is sent to the terminal.

     disconnect
           A synonym for close.

     form [ _f_o_r_m_a_t-_n_a_m_e
           ]" 6 Sets the carriage control format subtype  of  the
           "representation  type"  to _f_o_r_m_a_t-_n_a_m_e. The only valid
           _f_o_r_m_a_t-_n_a_m_e is non-print,  which  corresponds  to  the
           default "non-print" subtype.

     get _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e
           [ _l_o_c_a_l-_f_i_l_e ]" 6 Retrieves the _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e and  store
           it on the local machine.
            If the local file name is not specified, it is  given
           the same name it has on the remote machine, subject to

           alteration by the current case, ntrans, and nmap  set-
           tings.    The  current  settings  for  "representation
           type", "file structure", and "transfer mode" are  used
           while transferring the file.

     glob  Toggles  filename  expansion,   or   "globbing",   for
           mdelete,  mget  and  mput.  If globbing is turned off,
           filenames are taken literally.

           Globbing for mput is done as in  sh(1).   For  mdelete
           and mget, each remote file name is expanded separately
           on the remote machine, and the lists are not merged.

           Expansion of a directory name is likely  to  be  radi-
           cally different from expansion of the name of an ordi-
           nary file: the exact  result  depends  on  the  remote
           operating  system and FTP server, and can be previewed
           by doing mls _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e_s -.

           mget and mput are not meant to transfer entire  direc-
           tory  subtrees of files.  You can do this by transfer-
           ring  a  tar(1)  archive  of  the  subtree  (using   a
           "representation  type" of "image" as set by the binary
           command).

     hash  Toggles hash-sign (#) printing  for  each  data  block
           transferred. The size of a data block is 8192 bytes.

     help [ _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
           ]" 6 Prints an informative message about  the  meaning
           of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d. If no argument is given, ftp prints a list
           of the known commands.

     lcd [ _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
           ]" 6  Changes  the  working  directory  on  the  local
           machine.   If  no  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y  is specified, the user's
           home directory is used.

     ls[ _r_e_m_o_t_e-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y | -al ] [ _l_o_c_a_l-_f_i_l_e
           ]" 6 Prints an abbreviated listing of the contents  of
           a directory on the remote machine. If _r_e_m_o_t_e-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
           is left unspecified, the current working directory  is
           used.

           The -a option lists all entries, including those  that
           begin  with  a dot (.), which are normally not listed.
           The -l option lists files in long format, giving mode,
           number of links, owner, group, size in bytes, and time
           of last modification for each file. If the file  is  a
           special  file,  the  size  field  instead contains the
           major and minor device numbers rather than a size.  If
           the  file  is a symbolic link, the filename is printed

           followed by "->" and the pathname  of  the  referenced
           file.

           If no local file is specified, or if _l_o_c_a_l-_f_i_l_e is  -,
           the output is sent to the terminal.

     macdef _m_a_c_r_o-_n_a_m_e
           Defines a macro. Subsequent lines are  stored  as  the
           macro  _m_a_c_r_o-_n_a_m_e;  a  null  line (consecutive NEWLINE
           characters in a file or <RETURN> characters  from  the
           terminal)  terminates  macro  input  mode.  There is a
           limit of 16 macros and 4096 total  characters  in  all
           defined  macros.  Macros  remain defined until a close
           command is executed.

           The macro processor interprets  $  and  \  as  special
           characters.  A  $ followed by a number (or numbers) is
           replaced by the corresponding argument  on  the  macro
           invocation  command line. A $ followed by an i signals
           that macro processor that the executing macro is to be
           looped. On the first pass, $i is replaced by the first
           argument on the macro invocation command line; on  the
           second  pass,  it  is replaced by the second argument,
           and so on. A \ followed by any character  is  replaced
           by that character. Use the \ to prevent special treat-
           ment of the $.

     mdelete _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e_s
           Deletes the _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e_s on the remote machine.

     mdir _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e_s _l_o_c_a_l-_f_i_l_e
           Like dir, except multiple remote files may  be  speci-
           fied.  If interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt
           the user to verify that the last  argument  is  indeed
           the target local file for receiving mdir output.

     mget _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e_s
           Expands the _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e_s on the remote machine and  do
           a  get for each file name thus produced.  See glob for
           details on  the  filename  expansion.  Resulting  file
           names  will  then  be  processed  according  to  case,
           ntrans, and nmap settings. Files are transferred  into
           the local working directory, which can be changed with
           lcd _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y; new local directories  can  be  created
           with ! mkdir _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.

     mkdir _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y-_n_a_m_e
           Makes a directory on the remote machine.

     mls _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e_s _l_o_c_a_l-_f_i_l_e

           fied.  If interactive prompting is on, ftp will prompt

           the user to verify that the last  argument  is  indeed
           the target local file for receiving mls output.

     mode [ _m_o_d_e-_n_a_m_e ]
           Sets the "transfer mode" to _m_o_d_e-_n_a_m_e. The only  valid
           _m_o_d_e-_n_a_m_e  is stream, which corresponds to the default
           "stream"  mode.  This  implementation  only   supports
           stream, and requires that it be specified.

     mput _l_o_c_a_l-_f_i_l_e_s
           Expands wild cards in the list of local files given as
           arguments  and do a put for each file in the resulting
           list. See glob  for  details  of  filename  expansion.
           Resulting  file names will then be processed according
           to ntrans and nmap settings.

     nmap [ _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n _o_u_t_p_a_t_t_e_r_n ]
           Sets or unsets the filename mapping mechanism.  If  no
           arguments  are specified, the filename mapping mechan-
           ism is  unset.  If  arguments  are  specified,  remote
           filenames are mapped during mput commands and put com-
           mands  issued  without  a  specified   remote   target
           filename.  If arguments are specified, local filenames
           are mapped  during  mget  commands  and  get  commands
           issued without a specified local target filename.

           This command is useful when connecting to a  non-UNIX-
           system  remote host with different file naming conven-
           tions or practices. The mapping  follows  the  pattern
           set  by  _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n and _o_u_t_p_a_t_t_e_r_n. _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n is a tem-
           plate for incoming filenames (which may  have  already
           been  processed  according to the ntrans and case set-
           tings).   Variable  templating  is   accomplished   by
           including  the sequences $1, $2, ..., $9 in _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n.
           Use \ to prevent this special treatment of the $ char-
           acter. All other characters are treated literally, and
           are used to  determine  the  nmap  _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n  variable
           values.

           For example, given _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n $1.$2 and the remote file
           name  mydata.data, $1 would have the value mydata, and
           $2 would have the value data.

           The  _o_u_t_p_a_t_t_e_r_n  determines   the   resulting   mapped
           filename.  The  sequences $1, $2, ..., $9 are replaced
           by any value resulting from  the  _i_n_p_a_t_t_e_r_n  template.
           The  sequence $0 is replaced by the original filename.
           Additionally, the sequence [_s_e_q_1,_s_e_q_2] is replaced  by
           _s_e_q_1  if  _s_e_q_1  is  not a null string; otherwise it is
           replaced by _s_e_q_2.

           For    example,    the    command    nmap     $1.$2.$3

           .myfile.  SPACE  characters may be included in _o_u_t_p_a_t_-
           _t_e_r_n, as in the example nmap $1 | sed "s/  *$//" > $1.
           Use  the  \  character to prevent special treatment of
           the $, [, ], and ,, characters.

     ntrans [ _i_n_c_h_a_r_s
           [ _o_u_t_c_h_a_r_s ] ]" 6 Sets or unsets the filename  charac-
           ter  translation mechanism. If no arguments are speci-
           fied, the filename character translation mechanism  is
           unset.  If  arguments  are  specified,  characters  in
           remote filenames are translated during  mput  commands
           and  put  commands  issued  without a specified remote
           target filename, and characters in local filenames are
           translated  during  mget  commands  and  get  commands
           issued without a specified local target filename.

           This command is useful when connecting to a  non-UNIX-
           system  remote host with different file naming conven-
           tions or practices. Characters in a filename  matching
           a   character   in   _i_n_c_h_a_r_s  are  replaced  with  the
           corresponding   character   in   _o_u_t_c_h_a_r_s.    If   the
           character's  position  in  _i_n_c_h_a_r_s  is longer than the
           length of _o_u_t_c_h_a_r_s, the character is deleted from  the
           file name.

           Only 16 characters can be translated  when  using  the
           ntrans  command  under ftp. Use case (described above)
           if needing to convert the entire alphabet.

     open _h_o_s_t
           [ _p_o_r_t ]" 6 Establishes a connection to the  specified
           _h_o_s_t  FTP  server. An optional port number may be sup-
           plied, in which case, ftp will attempt to  contact  an
           FTP  server  at that port. If the _a_u_t_o-_l_o_g_i_n option is
           on  (default  setting),  ftp  will  also  attempt   to
           automatically log the user in to the FTP server.

     prompt
           Toggles interactive prompting.  Interactive  prompting
           occurs  during  multiple  file  transfers to allow the
           user  to  selectively  retrieve  or  store  files.  By
           default,  prompting  is  turned  on.  If  prompting is
           turned off, any mget or mput will transfer all  files,
           and any mdelete will delete all files.

     proxy _f_t_p-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d
           Executes an FTP command on a secondary control connec-
           tion.  This  command allows simultaneous connection to

           two remote FTP servers for transferring files  between
           the  two servers. The first proxy command should be an
           open, to establish the secondary  control  connection.
           Enter  the  command proxy ?  to see other FTP commands
           executable on the secondary connection.

           The following commands behave  differently  when  pre-
           faced by proxy: open will not define new macros during
           the auto-login process, close will not erase  existing
           macro  definitions,  get  and mget transfer files from
           the host on the primary control connection to the host
           on  the  secondary control connection, and put, mputd,
           and append transfer files from the host on the  secon-
           dary  control  connection  to  the host on the primary
           control connection.

           Third party file transfers depend upon support of  the
           PASV  command  by  the server on the secondary control
           connection.

     put _l_o_c_a_l-_f_i_l_e[ _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e ]
           Stores  a  local  file  on  the  remote  machine.   If
           _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e  is  left unspecified, the local file name
           is used after processing according to  any  ntrans  or
           nmap settings in naming the remote file. File transfer
           uses the current settings for  "representation  type",
           "file structure", and "transfer mode".

     pwd   Prints the name of the current  working  directory  on
           the remote machine.

     rmdir _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y-_n_a_m_e
           Deletes a directory on the remote machine.

     runique
           Toggles storing of files  on  the  local  system  with
           unique filenames. If a file already exists with a name
           equal to the target local filename for a get  or  mget
           command,  a .1 is appended to the name. If the result-
           ing name  matches  another  existing  file,  a  .2  is
           appended to the original name. If this process contin-
           ues up to .99, an error message is  printed,  and  the
           transfer  does  not  take  place. The generated unique
           filename will be reported.  runique  will  not  affect
           local  files  generated  from  a  shell  command.  The
           default value is off.

           [ _r_e_m_o_t_e-_f_i_l_e ]" 6 A synonym for put.

     sendport
           Toggles the use of PORT commands. By default, ftp will
           attempt to use a PORT command when establishing a con-
           nection for each data transfer. The use of  PORT  com-
           mands can prevent delays when performing multiple file
           transfers. If the PORT command fails, ftp will use the
           default  data  port.  When the use of PORT commands is
           disabled, no attempt will be made to use PORT commands
           for each data transfer.  This is useful when connected
           to certain FTP implementations that ignore  PORT  com-
           mands   but   incorrectly   indicate  they  have  been
           accepted.

     status
           Show the current status of ftp.

     struct [ _s_t_r_u_c_t-_n_a_m_e ]
           Sets the file structure to _s_t_r_u_c_t-_n_a_m_e. The only valid
           _s_t_r_u_c_t-_n_a_m_e  is file, which corresponds to the default
           "file" structure.  The  implementation  only  supports
           file, and requires that it be specified.

     sunique
           Toggles storing  of  files  on  remote  machine  under
           unique  file names. The remote FTP server must support
           the STOU command for successful completion. The remote

           valid _t_y_p_e-_n_a_m_es are ascii for "network ASCII", binary
           or image for "image", and tenex for "local byte  size"
           with  a  byte  size  of  8  (used  to  talk  to  TENEX
           machines). If no type is specified, the  current  type
           is printed.  The default type is "network ASCII".

     user _u_s_e_r-_n_a_m_e
           [ _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d ] [ _a_c_c_o_u_n_t ]" 6 Identify yourself  to  the
           remote  FTP  server.  If the password is not specified
           and the server requires it, ftp will prompt  the  user
           for  it  (after  disabling  local echo). If an account
           field is not specified, and the  FTP  server  requires
           it,  the  user  will be prompted for it. If an account
           field is specified, an account command will be relayed
           to  the remote server after the login sequence is com-
           pleted if the remote server did  not  require  it  for
           logging  in.  Unless  ftp is invoked with "auto-login"
           disabled, this process is done automatically  on  ini-
           tial connection to the FTP server.

     verbose
           Toggles verbose mode. In verbose mode,  all  responses
           from  the  FTP  server  are  displayed to the user. In
           addition, if verbose mode is on, when a file  transfer
           completes,  statistics regarding the efficiency of the
           transfer are reported. By default, verbose mode is  on
           if  ftp's commands are coming from a terminal, and off
           otherwise.

     Command arguments which have embedded spaces may  be  quoted
     with quote (") marks.

     If any command argument which  is  not  indicated  as  being

     ment.

ABORTING A FILE TRANSFER
     To abort a file transfer, use the  terminal  interrupt  key.
     Sending  transfers  will  be  immediately  halted. Receiving

User Commands                                              ftp(1)



     transfers will be halted by sending  an  FTP  protocol  ABOR
     command  to  the  remote  server, and discarding any further
     data received. The  speed  at  which  this  is  accomplished
     depends  upon  the remote server's support for ABOR process-
     ing. If the remote server does not support the ABOR command,
     an  ftp>  prompt will not appear until the remote server has
     completed sending the requested file.

     The terminal interrupt key sequence will be ignored when ftp
     has  completed  any local processing and is awaiting a reply
     from the remote server. A long delay in this mode may result
     from the ABOR processing described above, or from unexpected
     behavior by the remote server, including violations  of  the
     ftp  protocol.  If  the delay results from unexpected remote
     server behavior, the local ftp program  must  be  killed  by
     hand.

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
     Local files specified as arguments to ftp commands are  pro-
     cessed according to the following rules.

     1)    If the file name - is specified,  the  standard  input
           (for  reading)  or  standard  output  (for writing) is
           used.

     2)    If the first character of the  file  name  is  |,  the
           remainder  of  the  argument is interpreted as a shell
           command. ftp then forks a shell, using popen(3C)  with
           the  argument  supplied,  and  reads (writes) from the
           standard output (standard input) of  that  shell.   If
           the  shell  command  includes  <SPACE> characters, the
           argument must be quoted; for example  "|  ls  -lt".  A
           particularly useful example of this mechanism is: "dir
           | more".

     3)    Failing the above  checks,  if  globbing  is  enabled,
           local  file  names are expanded according to the rules
           used in the sh(1); see the glob command.  If  the  ftp
           command  expects  a  single  local  file (for example,
           put), only the first filename generated by  the  glob-
           bing operation is used.

     4)    For mget commands and get  commands  with  unspecified
           local  file  names,  the  local filename is the remote
           filename, which may be altered by a case,  ntrans,  or
           nmap  setting.  The  resulting  filename  may  then be
           altered if runique is on.

     5)    For mput commands and put  commands  with  unspecified
           remote  file  names,  the remote filename is the local
           filename, which may be altered by  a  ntrans  or  nmap
           setting. The resulting filename may then be altered by

FILE TRANSFER PARAMETERS
     The FTP specification specifies many  parameters  which  may
     affect a file transfer.

     The "representation type" may be  one  of  "network  ASCII",
     "EBCDIC",  "image",  or  "local  byte size" with a specified
     byte size (for PDP-10's and PDP-20's mostly).  The  "network
     ASCII"  and  "EBCDIC"  types  have  a  further subtype which
     specifies whether vertical format control  (NEWLINE  charac-
     ters,  form  feeds,  etc.)  are  to be passed through ("non-
     print"), provided in  TELNET  format  ("TELNET  format  con-
     trols"),  or  provided  in  ASA (FORTRAN) ("carriage control
     (ASA)") format. ftp supports the  "network  ASCII"  (subtype
     "non-print"  only) and "image" types, plus "local byte size"
     with a byte size of 8 for communicating with TENEX machines.

     The "file structure" may be one of file  (no  record  struc-
     ture), record, or page. ftp supports only the default value,
     which is file.

     The  "transfer  mode"  may  be  one  of  stream,  block,  or
     compressed.  ftp  supports  only the default value, which is
     stream.

USAGE
     See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of  ftp
     when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2
    **31bytes).

     The ftp command is IPv6-enabled. See ip6(7P).

NOTES
     Failure to log in may arise from an explicit denial  by  the
     remote   FTP   server  because  the  account  is  listed  in
     /etc/ftpusers. See in.ftpd(1M) and ftpusers(4).

     Correct execution  of  many  commands  depends  upon  proper
     behavior by the remote server.

     An error in the treatment of carriage returns in the 4.2 BSD
     code  handling  transfers  with  a  "representation type" of
     "network ASCII" has  been  corrected.  This  correction  may
     result  in  incorrect  transfers of binary files to and from
     4.2 BSD servers using a "representation  type"  of  "network
     ASCII". Avoid this problem by using the "image" type.
